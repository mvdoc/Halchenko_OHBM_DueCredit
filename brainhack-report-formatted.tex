\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Data analysis software and canonical datasets are the driving force
behind many fields of empirical sciences. Despite being of paramount
importance, those resources are most often not adequately cited.
Although some can consider this a ``social'' problem, its roots are
technical: Users of those resources often are simply not aware of the
underlying computational libraries and methods they have been using in
their research projects. This in-turn fosters inefficient practices that
encourage the development of new projects, instead of contributing to
existing established ones. Some projects (e.g.~FSL
\cite{smith2004advances}) facilitate citation of the utilized methods,
but such efforts are not uniform, and the output is rarely in commonly
used citation formats (e.g.~BibTeX). DueCredit is a simple framework to
embed information about publications or other references within the
original code or dataset descriptors. References are automatically
reported to the user whenever a given functionality or dataset is being
used.

\section{Approach}\label{approach}

DueCredit is currently available for Python, but we envision extending
support to other frameworks (e.g., Matlab, R). Until DueCredit gets
adopted natively by the projects, it provides the functionality to
``inject'' references for 3rd party modules.

For the developer, DueCredit implements a decorator \texttt{@due.dcite}
that allows to link a method or class to a set of references that can be
specified through a doi or BibTeX entry. For example (from PyMVPA):

\begin{verbatim}
@due.dcite(
    Doi('10.1016/j.neuron.2011.08.026'),
    description="Hyperalignment of data to a ...",
    tags=["implementation"])
def train(self, datasets):
    """Derive a common feature space ...
    ....
\end{verbatim}

The end-user simply needs to run the script loading the
\texttt{duecredit} module. For example, with the following minimal
script

\begin{verbatim}
# A tiny analysis script to demonstrate duecredit
#
# Import of duecredit is not necessary if you just run
# this script with
#    python -m duecredit
# import duecredit  # Just to enable duecredit
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

print("I: Simulating 4 blobs")
data, true_label = make_blobs(centers=4)

dist = pdist(data, metric='euclidean')

Z = linkage(dist, method='single')
print("I: Done clustering 4 blobs")
\end{verbatim}

by running it with \texttt{python\ -m\ duecredit}, we get a summary of
the packages and methods used

\begin{verbatim}
$python -m duecredit example_scipy.py
I: Simulating 4 blobs
I: Done clustering 4 blobs
DueCredit Report:
- Scientific tools library / numpy (v 1.10.4) [1]
- Scientific tools library / scipy (v 0.17) [2]
  - Single linkage hierarchical clustering ... [3]
- Machine Learning library / sklearn (v 0.17) [4]

\section{Results}\label{results}

The initial release of DueCredit (0.1.0) was implemented during the OHBM
2015 hackathon and uploaded to pypi and is freely available. DueCredit
provides a concise API to associate a publication reference with any
given module or function. For example: To provide a reference for an
entire module the cite function can be used, while functions and methods
can be conveniently decorated using dcite. DueCredit comes with a simple
demo code which demonstrates its utility. Running a sample analysis
produces a summary of references. At each run, the information is stored
in a pickled file, and incremental runs update that file. Thus,
DueCredit summary can be used to show that information again or export
it as a BibTeX file ready for reuse.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

DueCredit is in its early stages of development, but two days of team
development at the OHBM hackathon were sufficient to establish a usable
prototype implementation. Since then, the code-base was further improved
and multiple beta-releases followed, expanding the coverage of citable
resources (e.g., within scipy, sklearn modules via injections and PyMVPA
natively).
